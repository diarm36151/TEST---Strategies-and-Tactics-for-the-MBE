<p class="calibre1"><a id="p134"></a><b class="calibre3">QUESTIONS</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">CIVIL PROCEDURE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Question 1</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">A pedestrian was injured in State A when a taxicab hit her while she was crossing  the  street.  The  pedestrian,  who  is  a  citizen  of  State  B,  sued  the cab-driver  (a  citizen  of  State  A)  for  negligence  in  State  A  court.  The pedestrian's lawyer then suggested that the pedestrian, as a State B citizen, might  do  better  with  a  suit  in  federal  rather  than  state  court.  Therefore, before the cab-driver filed an answer, the pedestrian voluntarily dismissed her state-court suit (as state law allowed), and filed a new suit in diversity in State A federal court against the cab-driver, alleging the same facts and theory of negligence as in the earliest state-court suit. The pedestrian then discovered  that  the  cab-driver  was  judgment-proof  and  that  the  cab  was owned  by  a  small  corporation,  Cab  Corp;  the  cab-driver  was  a  minority shareholder  of  Cab  Corp.  and  the  cab-driver's  wife  owned  the  remaining majority  interest.  Therefore,  acting  before  the  cab-driver  answered  the federal suit, the pedestrian filed a notice with the federal court voluntarily dismissing  that  suit;  the  notice  did  not  attempt  to  specify  what  effect  the dismissal would have on future suits. Two weeks later, the pedestrian filed a new diversity action, still in State A federal court, against the cab-driver and  Cab  Corp.,  alleging  that  the  cab-driver  had  negligently  caused  the accident and that Cab Corp., as owner of the cab, was vicariously liable for that  negligence  under  State  A  tort  principles.  Prior  to  answering,  both defendants  have  now  moved  to  have  the  complaint  dismissed  on  the grounds that the two prior dismissals compel this result. Should the court grant the dismissal motion? </p>
<p class="calibre1">(A) No, because the cab-driver had not answered or moved against either of the two prior complaints before they were dismissed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(B) No, because the first dismissal was in state rather than federal court. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(C) No, because the third suit involves different parties than the first two suits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(D) Yes, because the pedestrian previously voluntarily dismissed the same claim twice, causing the second dismissal to be with prejudice. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Question 2</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">134</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p135"></a>A  driver  was  badly  injured  when  her  car  ran  off  the  road  for  unknown reasons and hit a tree, and the car's airbags did not inflate. The driver sued the manufacturer in a federal diversity action for product liability, alleging that  there  was  a  defect  in  the  airbags'  inflating  mechanism.  At  the  jury trial, the plaintiff's lawyer offered testimony by two other consumers that the airbags in their cars, which were the same model and manufacturer as the driver's car, also failed to trigger during collisions. The manufacturer's lawyer  objected  to  the  evidence,  arguing  (without  factual  contradiction from  the  plaintiff)  that  the  speed  and  other  circumstances  in  the  two witnesses'  collisions  had  not  been  shown  to  be  substantially  similar  to those  of  the  present  case,  creating  a  large  risk  that  these  witnesses' </p>
<p class="calibre1">testimony  would  mislead  the  jury  and  be  unfairly  prejudicial  to  the defense. The trial judge allowed the two witnesses to testify, and the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff. The manufacturer appealed; one of  its  arguments  on  appeal  was  that  the  two  witnesses'  testimony  about their airbags' failure should have been excluded as irrelevant, misleading, and highly prejudicial. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What standard will the appeals court use in evaluating this argument? </p>
<p class="calibre1">(A) An “abuse of discretion” standard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(B) A “clearly erroneous” standard, applied while giving due regard to the trial court's opportunity to judge the proposed witnesses' credibility. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(C) A “de novo” standard, giving no special deference to the trial court's decision to admit the evidence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(D) A “harmless error” standard, requiring reversal unless the reviewing court believes that the evidence ruling was not only erroneous but probably changed the trial's outcome. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Question 3</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Plaintiff,  a  State  A  citizen,  worked  in  a  plant  in  State  A  operated  by Defendant,  a  company  that  manufactures  radioactive  materials  used exclusively by the federal government. Defendant is incorporated in State B,  but  conducts  all  of  its  day-to-day  operations  (including  all manufacturing, shipping, accounting, and sales-generation activities) at the State A plant. Defendant's corporate officers all work from a small office in State C, from which they direct, control, and coordinate the company's activities.  Plaintiff  was  injured  by  radiation  burns  from  radioactive materials he was handling at the State A plant, due to a fellow employee's negligent  removal  of  a  warning  sign  on  the  materials.  Plaintiff  sued 135</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p136"></a>Defendant  for  negligence  in  a  State  A  state  court  (located  in  State  A's capital  city  of  Cap  City)  for  $100,000.  The  complaint  alleged  that  under <i class="calibre4">respondeat  superior, </i>  Defendant  was  liable  to  Plaintiff  for  his  personal injuries  caused  by  the  fellow  employee's  negligence.  Defendant  timely removed  the  action  to  the  federal  district  court  located  in  Cap  City. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Defendant then filed an answer in the federal court denying liability, citing (correctly) a federal statute that gives any defense contractor an affirmative defense  to  any  federal-law-based  or  state-law-based  negligence  claim  by an employee if the claim is premised on the  <i class="calibre4">respondeat superior</i> doctrine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now,  in  the  State  A  federal  court,  Plaintiff  opposes  the  removal  and moves to have the case transferred back to the State A state court where it was  originally  filed.  Should  the  federal  court  grant  Plaintiff's  transfer motion? </p>
<p class="calibre1">(A) Yes, because the fact that Defendant conducts its day-to-day operations in, and maintains its inventory in, State A causes it to be a citizen of that state, nullifying Defendant's right of removal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(B) No, because Defendant is a citizen solely of States B and C and Plaintiff is a citizen of State A, thereby creating complete diversity and satisfying all requirements for Defendant to have a right to remove to the State A federal court. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(C) Yes, because Plaintiff is a citizen of State A and Defendant is a citizen of both State A and State C, preventing the required complete diversity from existing and nullifying Defendant's right of removal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(D) No, because the case presents a federal question, thereby entitling Defendant to remove whether or not it is a citizen of State A, in whose state courts the action was originally filed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Question 4</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">A  doctor,  a  citizen  of  State  A,  went  to  shop  at  a  factory  outlet  for computers  located  in  that  state.  The  outlet  was  operated  by  a  corporation that  makes  computers  and  sells  them  throughout  the  U.S.  While  at  the outlet, the doctor fell down the stairs in a poorly-lit stairwell, hit his head, and died instantly. The doctor died intestate, leaving only one relative and heir, his son, who is a citizen of State B. The son procured from the State B courts an order appointing him as the doctor's personal representative for purposes  of  bringing  any  wrongful-death  action  on  behalf  of  the  doctor's estate. The son then commenced a wrongful death action for negligence in the  State  B  courts  for  $1  million  against  the  corporation;  the  complaint 136</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p137"></a>listed  the  plaintiff  as  being  the  son  suing  “as  personal  representative  of” </p>
<p class="calibre1">the estate of the doctor and stated that the son was a citizen of State B. The corporation  then  removed  the  suit  to  the  federal  district  court  located  in State  B,  and  in  its  removal  petition  asserted  that  there  was  diversity  of citizenship.  The  corporation's  headquarters  are  located  in  a  2,000  square foot  office  in  State  A,  from  which  all  3  officers  of  the  corporation supervise  the  corporation's  activities.  Three-quarters  of  the  corporation's employees work in a 200,000 square-foot plant located in State C, at which all  of  the  computers  made  and  sold  by  the  corporation  are  manufactured. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The corporation is incorporated in State D, where it has no employees or operations. All required pleadings were served several months ago, and the son has not opposed the removal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You are the clerk for the federal judge sitting in State B who has been assigned  the  suit.  The  judge  asks  you  for  advice  about  how  she  should resolve  any  issue  that  may  exist  relating  to  the  court's  subject-matter jurisdiction over the case. You should tell her that her court (A) has jurisdiction and may hear the case, because the son is a citizen of State B and the corporation is a citizen of States C and D only, thereby creating complete diversity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(B) has jurisdiction and may hear the case, because the son is a citizen of State B and the corporation is a citizen of State D only, thereby creating complete diversity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(C) does not have jurisdiction and may not hear the case, because the doctor was a citizen of State A at his death and the corporation is a citizen of States A and D, thereby preventing complete diversity from existing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(D) may hear the case whether or not complete diversity exists, because the son has by now waived any objection based on lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Question 5</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Plaintiff  is  a  State  A  corporation  that  rents  stage  equipment  for  use  in theatrical  performances.  Defendant  is  a  small  theater  group  that  entered into a rental agreement with Plaintiff. Defendant is incorporated in State A and  its  main  theater  is  in  that  state.  Defendant's  latest  show  was  a  box office failure. Defendant has been unable to pay Plaintiff the annual rental fee,  and  Plaintiff  wanted  to  compel  payment  by  means  of  a  federal-court suit.  Therefore,  Plaintiff  assigned  its  interest  in  the  rental  agreement  for 137</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p138"></a>“one dollar” to Lawyer, an individual who lives and works in nearby State B. By separate agreement, Lawyer agreed that if he litigated or settled the assigned  claim,  he  would  pay  Plaintiff  two-thirds  of  any  recovery  he received,  “solely  as  a  bonus.”  Under  State  A  law,  an  assignment  is  legal</p>
<p class="calibre1">“when made for valid consideration, even if only for a nominal amount.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  the  assignment,  Lawyer  sued  Defendant  in  diversity  in  federal district  court  for  the  District  of  State  A,  alleging  breach  of  the  rental agreement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Defendant  has  moved  to  dismiss  the  action  for  lack  of  subject-matter jurisdiction.  Assuming  the  amount-in-controversy  is  satisfied,  the  district court should</p>
<p class="calibre1">(A) grant the motion because diversity jurisdiction is not available if any defendant is a citizen of the state in which the federal court sits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(B) deny the motion, because Lawyer and Defendant are citizens of different states, and the assignment was legal under state law. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(C) grant the motion, because the assignment was collusively made for the purpose of creating diversity of citizenship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(D) deny the motion, because Defendant and Lawyer are citizens of different states, and Lawyer has a sufficiently large economic stake in the outcome to motivate him to vigorously litigate the suit. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Question 6</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">A  consumer  brought  a  diversity  suit  against  a  baker  in  State  A  federal district  court,  alleging  that  the  baker  made  a  defectively  dangerous croissant  that  contained  glass  fragments  that  injured  the  consumer.  The complaint  asserted  that  the  baker  made  the  croissant  at  his  sole proprietorship  in  State  B,  sold  the  croissant  to  a  State  B  wholesaler,  who sold  it  to  a  restaurant  in  State  A,  where  the  consumer  bought  it,  ate  it, badly cut his mouth, and had to be hospitalized for nearly a week. The suit sought $100,000 in damages. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  baker  appeared  in  the  action  via  his  lawyer  and  filed  an  answer consisting solely of a general denial. The baker did not attend the trial and relied  on  his  lawyer  to  conduct  the  trial  without  calling  witnesses  and relying  solely  on  the  lawyer's  cross-examination  of  the  consumer's witnesses. The trial evidence showed that the baker had never travelled to State  A,  sold  all  items  he  baked  solely  to  wholesalers  located  in  State  B, and  did  no  advertising  outside  of  State  B.  On  June  1,  the  jury  awarded $55,000  to  the  consumer  for  various  categories  of  damages.  The  baker 138</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p139"></a>made  a  post-trial  motion  to  set  aside  the  verdict  on  various  grounds, including lack of jurisdiction; the motion was denied by the judge on July 1.  On  July  15,  the  judge  had  the  court  clerk  file  a  judgment  against  the baker  for  $55,000,  and  notice  of  the  entry  of  judgment  was  sent  to  the baker's  lawyer.  On  Sept.  20,  the  baker  via  his  lawyer  filed  a  notice  of appeal  with  the  clerk  of  the  district  court.  The  notice  of  appeal  correctly listed  the  parties  and  the  judgment  being  appealed  from,  and  the  parties then timely submitted briefs to the federal Court of Appeals for the circuit encompassing State A. The baker based his appeal on two errors: that the district  court  had  lacked  subject-matter  jurisdiction  due  to  the  award  of less than $75,000, and that the court lacked personal jurisdiction over him because he did not have minimum contacts with State A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How will the Court of Appeals likely rule in the appeal? </p>
<p class="calibre1">(A) The court will dismiss the appeal because it lacks jurisdiction, whether or not the district court had subject matter and personal jurisdiction over the action. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(B) The court will reverse the judgment, because the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over the baker. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(C) The court will reverse the judgment, because the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the action. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(D) The court will affirm the judgment, because the baker waived both of the jurisdiction-related defenses at the district-court level. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Question 7</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Company  is  a  for-profit  corporation  that  at  the  time  of  the  relevant transactions  was  incorporated  in  and  headquartered  in  State  A.  Company hired  Partnership,  a  two-partner  general  partnership  of  the  state  where  it was organized, to redesign its computer system so as to improve security. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Partnership's  two  members  were  and  are  citizens  of  State  B  and  State  C</p>
<p class="calibre1">respectively. After the contract work was done, the system was hacked by unknown  persons,  causing  Company  to  sue  Partnership  for  breach  of contract  in  federal  district  court  for  State  A.  The  suit  sought  damages  in excess  of  $75,000.  Partnership  did  not  initially  challenge  subject-matter jurisdiction.  During  discovery,  and  after  the  time  to  make  threshold objections  had  passed,  Partnership  learned  that  Company  had reincorporated in State B during the course of the lawsuit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Partnership now moves to dismiss the action for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. How should the court resolve the motion? </p>
<p class="calibre1">139</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p140"></a> (A) The court should deny the motion because it was made too late. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(B) The court should grant the motion, dismiss the action, and sanction Company for having withheld information pertinent to jurisdiction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(C) The court should deny the motion because the court has subject-matter jurisdiction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(D) The court should remand the matter to State A state court to be tried there. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Question 8</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">An  animal-rights  protester  joined  others  in  carrying  a  picket  sign  on  the front  steps  of  a  U.S.  Army  facility  in  which,  the  protesters  claimed,  the Army was conducting experiments that abused monkeys. A military police officer  employed  by  the  Army  arrested  the  protester  for  trespassing  and forcibly handcuffed him. The protester brought a federal civil suit against the officer for violation of a federal statute making a person civilly liable for violating another person's constitutional rights under color of federal or state  law  (in  this  case,  for  violating  the  protester's  Fourth  Amendment rights). After discovery and before trial, the officer made two motions: (1) a  motion  for  summary  judgment  on  the  grounds  that  his  behavior  was objectively reasonable and was therefore not a substantive violation of the protester's  constitutional  rights;  and  (2)  a  motion  to  dismiss  the  claim based  on  the  judge-made  doctrine  of  qualified  immunity,  under  which  a government official has civil immunity from trial if he reasonably though incorrectly  believes  that  his  conduct  is  lawful.  The  district  court  denied both  motions  on  the  grounds  that  it  could  not  be  said  as  a  matter  of  law that the protester would not be able to establish the officer's civil liability at  trial.  The  judge  then  ordered  a  trial.  The  officer  immediately  appealed the  rulings  denying  each  of  his  motions.  The  protester  now  argues  in  the Court  of  Appeals  that  neither  ruling  is  properly  appealable  until  after  the case  has  been  tried.  How  should  the  Court  of  Appeals  rule  as  to  the timeliness of the appeals of the two rulings? </p>
<p class="calibre1">(A) Neither the summary judgment ruling nor the immunity ruling is properly appealable now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(B) Both of the rulings are properly appealable now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(C) The immunity ruling is appealable now, but the summary judgment ruling is not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(D) The summary judgment ruling is appealable now, but the immunity ruling is not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">140</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p141"></a> <b class="calibre3">Question 9</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">A  teacher  who  was  suffering  from  abdominal  pain  agreed  to  be  operated on by a surgeon who practiced in State A. Immediately after the operation, the  teacher  developed  a  pelvic  infection,  which  she  suspected  was  the result of negligence by the surgeon during the operation. The teacher then consulted  a  tort  lawyer,  who  urged  that  the  teacher  retain  her  to  bring  a federal diversity action in State A federal district court against the surgeon for medical malpractice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  lawyer  prepared  a  complaint  that  in  its  first  count  alleged malpractice.  Without  consulting  the  teacher,  the  lawyer  added  a  second count alleging that the surgeon, in his advertising to the public, had made various  false  advertising  claims  (e.g.,  that  he  graduated  from  State  A University  Medical  School),  and  that  these  false  claims  constituted  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">“pattern of racketeering activity” in violation of a State A anti-racketeering criminal  statute.  The  teacher  read  the  draft  complaint,  understood  merely that it was a suit for “medical malpractice,” did not know what was meant by “pattern of racketeering activity,” and authorized the lawyer to file the complaint.  The  lawyer  signed  the  complaint  and  brought  the  action. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During  discovery,  it  became  clear  that  (1)  the  lawyer's  only  reason  for believing  the  surgeon  had  made  false  advertising  claims  was  hearsay passed on to the lawyer by a colleague (and the lawyer did not check with the  Medical  School,  which  would  immediately  have  confirmed  that  the surgeon  really   <i class="calibre4">did</i>  graduate  from  the  School);  (2)  the  claims  of  false advertising  were  in  fact  themselves  all  false;  and  (3)  the  lawyer  had previously made virtually the same racketeering allegations in a state-court malpractice  suit  against  the  same  surgeon  on  behalf  of  a  different  client, which allegations had been dismissed on summary judgment as being both legally and factually completely without merit. Defense counsel therefore drafted a motion reciting the above facts about the racketeering count and seeking  as  a  Rule  11  sanction  an  award  against  both  the  teacher  and  her lawyer  of  the  attorney's  fees  actually  spent  by  the  surgeon  in  defending against  the  count.  Defense  counsel  followed  proper  procedures  for  filing and serving the motion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Assume  that  the  federal  court  has  now  concluded  that  the  motion's allegation that there was no factual or legal basis for the racketeering count was  correct.  The  court,  in  response  to  the  defense  motion  for  attorney's fees as a sanction under Rule 11</p>
<p class="calibre1">(A) may order that the surgeon be reimbursed for the defense attorney's 141</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p142"></a>fees, with the teacher to be vicariously liable for the reimbursement if the teacher's lawyer does not pay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(B) may order that the teacher reimburse the surgeon for the defense attorney's fees, because the teacher should have known that she did not have actual knowledge about whether there was evidentiary support for the racketeering charge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(C) may not order the teacher's lawyer to reimburse the surgeon for the defense attorney's fees, because Rule 11 sanctions, if monetary, must take the form of fines paid to the court. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(D) may order that the teacher's lawyer reimburse the surgeon for the defense attorney's fees even if the lawyer honestly believed the racketeering count was supported by evidence, if the court finds that the lawyer failed to make reasonable inquiries into whether there was factual support for the count. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Question 10</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">A  broker,  who  was  African  American,  worked  for  a  brokerage  company. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  broker  applied  to  be  promoted  to  supervisor,  but  the  company's  sole owner  awarded  the  promotion  to  a  white  male  who  worked  in  the  same office.  The  broker  quit  and  then  sued  the  company  in  federal  court  for violating  a  federal  statute  prohibiting  intentional  racial  discrimination  in employment. The complaint quoted several detailed conversations that the broker claimed to have overheard in the office, in which the owner said he would  never  promote  the  plaintiff  or  any  other  African  American  as  a supervisor  because  blacks  rarely  have  managerial  talent.  The  company filed a general denial. Shortly thereafter, the company moved for summary judgment  on  the  grounds  that  there  was  no  evidence  that  the  owner's decision  to  pass  over  the  broker  for  the  promotion  was  caused  by  racial animus. In support of the motion, the company submitted an affidavit from the owner in which he stated, “I never made any of the statements imputed to  me  in  the  complaint;  all  of  those  supposed  statements  are  lies  the plaintiff is telling in order to coerce me into settling this suit.” The broker's lawyer,  who  was  out-of-state  tending  to  a  dying  parent,  failed  to  submit papers  in  opposition  to  the  motion  within  the  allowable  time.  The  trial judge  granted  summary  judgment  in  favor  of  the  defendant.  The  full  text of  the  judge's  opinion  was  as  follows:  “Because  the  plaintiff  failed  to submit papers in opposition to the motion, I will treat all statements made by  the  defendant  and  its  owner  as  undisputed.  Therefore,  I  find  that  the plaintiff has come forward with no evidence which would be sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to find that the plaintiff has carried his burden of 142</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p143"></a>proving that he was passed over on account of his race.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  broker  has  appealed  the  grant  of  summary  judgment.  Will  the Court of Appeals likely reverse the grant of summary judgment? </p>
<p class="calibre1">(A) Yes, because the owner's moving papers established that the broker's credibility was a central issue that must be resolved during a trial rather than as a matter of law. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(B) Yes, because the complaint contained detailed factual allegations that, if believed by a jury, would justify a finding that the defendant violated the plaintiff's federal rights. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(C) No, because the broker's failure to submit papers in opposition to the motion meant that there was no sworn affidavit as required to support the factual allegations of the complaint. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(D) No, because the broker's failure to submit papers in opposition to the motion constituted a default, entitling the judge to treat the defendant's uncontested allegations as true. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Question 11</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Plaintiff, while a pedestrian, was struck by a truck owned by Defendant, a corporation  in  the  business  of  making  local  deliveries.  The  truck  was driven  by  Driver,  a  full-time  employee  of  Defendant.  Since  Plaintiff  and Defendant  were  citizens  of  different  states,  Plaintiff  brought  a  diversity suit  in  Defendant's  home  state  against  Defendant  for  negligence,  seeking more than $75,000 in damages. Plaintiff elected not to make Driver (who left Defendant's employ soon after the accident) a co-defendant. Defendant served  an  answer  denying  liability  on  the  grounds  that  the  accident occurred because Driver had a sudden epileptic seizure that neither Driver nor  Defendant  could  have  foreseen.  Plaintiff  then  served  on  Defendant  a motion  under  FRCP  35  to  compel  Defendant  to  produce  Driver  for  a physical  examination  to  be  conducted  by  a  physician  identified  in  the motion  papers.  In  support  of  the  motion,  Plaintiff  asserted  that  the examination  was  necessary  in  order  for  Plaintiff's  attorneys  to  assess  the accuracy  of  Defendant's  assertion  that  the  accident  was  caused  by  a seizure. Defendant opposed the motion. The district court hearing the suit should rule on Plaintiff's motion by</p>
<p class="calibre1">(A) granting the discovery request because a physical examination is relevant to at least one claim or defense in the action. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(B) denying the discovery request because Driver no longer works for 143</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p144"></a>Defendant and is thus not under Defendant's legal control. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(C) denying the discovery request unless the court finds that Plaintiff has shown good cause for the examination. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Question 12</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">On  January  1  three  years  ago,  Defendant,  a  technology  company,  hired Plaintiff,  a  technology  specialist,  on  a  one-year  contract  terminable  only for  cause.  The  parties  agreed  that  any  dispute  was  to  be  governed  by  the substantive  law  of  State  A.  Three  months  after  the  contract  began, Defendant  fired  Plaintiff  on  April  1  for  what  Plaintiff  believed  was  no cause  at  all.  The  statute  of  limitations  on  a  contract  action,  according  to State A's laws, is three years, and was therefore about to expire on April 1</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  this  year.  Consequently,  on  March  15  of  this  year,  Plaintiff  filed  a diversity  action  against  Defendant  in  federal  district  court  for  State  A alleging  that  the  firing  breached  her  contract.  On  June  1  of  this  year, Plaintiff remembered that on May 1 three years ago (i.e., 30 days after the firing),  Defendant  wrongfully  interfered  with  Plaintiff's  ability  to  take  a new job (also in State A) that another potential employer had offered her by  falsely  telling  the  new  employer  that  Defendant  had  recently  fired Plaintiff for cheating on her expense account. Therefore, on June 2 of this year,  Plaintiff  amended  her  suit  to  add  a  new  state-law  claim:  that  by telling  this  lie,  Defendant  tortiously  interfered  with  Plaintiff's  new employment contract. The statute of limitations for tortious interference in State A is also three years; therefore, if the new tortious-interference claim had been a separate action, it would have become time-barred in the courts of State A on May 1 of this year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Defendant  has  now  moved  in  federal  court  to  have  the  tortious-interference  claim  dismissed  as  time-barred.  Under  the  procedural  law  of State A, when an existing complaint is amended, the doctrine of “relation back” applies for statute of limitations purposes if and only if any newly-added claims (1) arise out of the same conduct, transaction, or occurrence as  set  out  in  the  original  pleading   <i class="calibre4">and</i>  (2)  are  supported  by  the  same  or nearly-same  legal  theory  as  at  least  one  claim  set  out  in  the  original pleading. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  Defendant's  motion  succeeds,  which  of  the  following  is  the  most likely  legal  explanation  for  that  success?  In  evaluating  each  choice, assume  that  any   <i class="calibre4">factual</i>  allegation  contained  in  that  choice  is  correct 144</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p145"></a>(though  do   <i class="calibre4">not</i>  necessarily  assume  that  any   <i class="calibre4">legal</i>  conclusion  the  choice draws from that fact is correct). </p>
<p class="calibre1">(A) Under State A law, the relation-back rule does not permit relation back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(B) The tort claim rests on a legal theory different from that of the original contract claim. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(C) The tort claim arose out of a different transaction or occurrence than the original contract claim. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(D) Plaintiff unduly delayed in amending her complaint. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Question 13</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Plaintiff, a company that manufactures pencils, is organized under the laws of  China  and  has  its  operating  plant  and  management  office  in  that country. It bought wood pulp from Defendant, a corporation incorporated and located in State A. The sales contract provided that “the laws of China will  govern  any  dispute  that  might  arise  between  the  parties  pertinent  to this  agreement.”  Defendant  was  late  in  delivering  the  wood  pulp,  and Plaintiff  sued  Defendant  in  State  A  federal  district  court.  Plaintiff  has  no office or agents in the United States, and the contract was negotiated and executed through the Internet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Defendant has moved to dismiss the action under the doctrine of  <i class="calibre4">forum</i> <i class="calibre4">non conveniens</i>  on  the  ground  that  the  case  should  be  heard  in  a  court  in China. How should the court resolve the motion? </p>
<p class="calibre1">(A) The court should grant the motion because the requirements of the federal “transfer of venue” statute are satisfied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(B) The court should deny the motion if a court in China will apply law less favorable to Plaintiff than will the Delaware district court. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(C) The court should grant the motion if it determines that China is an appropriate alternative forum for the lawsuit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(D) The court has a duty to first establish that it has jurisdiction before deciding the motion to dismiss. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Question 14</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">A musician, who lived in State A, was a member of a touring rock band. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  a  day  the  musician  was  away  from  State  A,  an  envelope  sent  “first class,  certified,  return  receipt  requested”  via  the  U.S.  Postal  Service  mail arrived at his residence. The envelope contained a summons and complaint 145</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p146"></a>for  an  action  being  brought  against  the  musician  by  an  accountant.  The summons and complaint stated on their face that the action was for breach of contract and was being brought in federal court for the district of State B,  which  was  the  accountant's  state  of  residence.  The  suit  was  properly based  on  diversity  and  met  the  jurisdictional  amount.  The  musician  had authorized  his  fiancée  to  accept  mailed  letters  and  packages  he  might receive  and  to  sign  receipts  for  them.  Therefore,  the  fiancée  signed  the delivery receipt for the envelope and handed the receipt to the mail carrier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  musician  never  answered  or  otherwise  responded  to  the  summons  or complaint,  and  the  court  in  due  course  entered  a  $1.7  million  default judgment against him. Two years after the entry of judgment, the musician happened to discover on the Internet that the default judgment against him had been entered. He immediately moved under FRCP Rule 60 to have the judgment set aside as void because proper service had never been made on him. At a judicial hearing on his motion, the musician testified that he had seen  the  original  sealed  certified-mail  envelope  on  his  desk  when  he returned  from  his  trip,  but  had  never  opened  it  because  he  thought  it related  to  some  other  completed  business  transaction.  The  accountant's lawyer  did  not  contest  this  factual  testimony.  At  the  time  of  the  original mailing,  neither  the  law  of  State  A  nor  the  law  of  State  B  authorized  instate  service  of  process  on  an  individual  by  means  of  certified  mail  (or, indeed, by any means other than personal service). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Should the federal judge set aside the default judgment as requested by the musician? </p>
<p class="calibre1">(A) Yes, but only if the judge finds that the musician was not negligent in failing to open the certified letter envelope. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(B) Yes, because the judgment was void due to lack of proper service on the musician. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(C) No, because the musician did not make his motion until more than one year had elapsed from the entry of the default judgment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(D) No, because the musician had authorized his fiancée to sign for mail, causing her receipt of the envelope to constitute valid service on the musician. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A consumer was driving a car late at night when the headlights went out, causing the consumer to run off the road and hit a tree, injuring him badly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The consumer brought a product liability suit in diversity against the car's 146</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p147"></a>manufacturer, a large publicly-traded corporation. The suit alleged that the headlight  system  failed  on  account  of  a  defective  design.  The  consumer demanded a jury trial. During voir dire, one prospective juror testified that he  owned  $100  of  publicly-traded  stock  in  the  defendant  manufacturer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Under  questioning  by  the  judge,  the  prospective  juror  said  that  she  was confident that her stock ownership would not interfere with her ability to be  impartial  in  the  case.  The  consumer's  lawyer  has  challenged  the prospective juror for cause. Should the judge dismiss the juror for cause? </p>
<p class="calibre1">(A) No, because the juror's financial stake is sufficiently small that it would not affect the ability of an average juror to be impartial. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(B) Yes, because there is a presumption that any direct financial relationship between a juror and a party will impair the juror's ability to be impartial. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(C) Yes, so long as there is at least one other potential juror in the pool who would not be challengeable for cause. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(D) No, so long as the judge believes the juror's testimony that she can be impartial. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Question 16</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Until she was fired, a cook worked in a restaurant owned by a corporation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  cook  sued  the  corporation  in  federal  court,  alleging  that  her  firing violated  a  federal  statute  forbidding  intentional  discrimination  against employees on the basis of gender. In her suit, the cook asked for an order that she be reinstated to her job, plus money damages as compensation for the  firing.  The  cook  also  timely  asked  for  a  jury  trial  on  the  issues  of liability  and  damages,  but  conceded  that  under  court  rules  the  decision about  reinstatement  would  have  to  be  made  by  the  judge.  During  jury selection,  the  two  sides  each  used  one  peremptory  challenge  during  the course  of  seating  the  first  10  members  of  a  proposed  12-member  jury  of whom  6  were  men  and  4  were  women.  Then,  as  to  the  next  prospective Jurors,  XX  and  YY  (who  if  accepted  would  fill  the  final  two  seats,  and who  were  both  women),  the  plaintiff  approved  these  jurors,  but  the defendant's  lawyer  announced  that  she  wanted  to  use  her  final  two peremptory challenges on them, giving as her only explanation that, “I'm sure these two ladies would be fair, but I think that on average males will be  more  sympathetic  to  my  client's  position  than  women  will  be.”  The judge is now prepared to decide two motions before him: Motion  1:  The  defendant  corporation  has  moved  to  have  the  facts 147</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p148"></a>bearing on “Did the defendant discriminate against the plaintiff on gender grounds?” tried first. Then, it argues, the judge should immediately decide whether  the  defendant  discriminated,  and  if  so,  whether  the  defendant should be ordered to reinstate the plaintiff. After that, the motion says, if the  court  found  that  discrimination  occurred,  the  jury  should  be  asked  to decide  on  the  amount  of  damages.  The  plaintiff  opposes  this  motion, saying  that  the  jury  should  first  decide  whether  there  was  discrimination, and  if  so,  decide  what  damages  to  award;  only  then  should  the  judge decide on reinstatement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Motion 2: The plaintiff has moved to have the defendant's peremptory challenges to potential jurors XX and YY disallowed, on the grounds that allowing  these  challenges  would  violate  the  excluded  jurors'  equal protection  right  not  to  be  disqualified  from  a  jury  on  account  of  their gender and that the plaintiff has standing to assert these jurors' rights. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The court will most likely rule on the two motions by (A) denying Motion 1 and granting Motion 2. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(B) granting Motion 1 and denying Motion 2. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(C) granting both motions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(D) denying both motions. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Question 17</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">A statute passed by the legislature of State A, the “Employee Check Act” </p>
<p class="calibre1">or  “ECA,”  provides  that  if  five  or  more  persons  work  in  the  state  for  a given  employer,  the  employer  may  pay  them  by  check  only  if  the employer offers the employees a free method of cashing the check within one mile or less of the workplace. The statute also provides a flat damages award  of  $1,000  per  employee  for  each  check  as  to  which  the  employer violates the ECA. A brokerage firm with many employees in State A failed to comply with the statute. Twenty employees of the firm, each of whom was  given  payroll  five  checks  in  violation  of  the  ECA,  joined  as  co-plaintiffs in a non-class-action suit against the brokerage firm filed in the State  A  state  courts;  each  plaintiff  asserted  a  claim  for  $5,000.  The brokerage  firm  promptly  filed  a  notice  removing  the  action  to  the  local federal  court  for  State  A.  Ninety  days  after  the  firm  filed  the  notice  of removal, all plaintiffs jointly filed a motion to remand the case to the State A court from which it had been removed, on the grounds that the case did not satisfy the relevant amount-in-controversy requirement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Should the court grant the plaintiffs' motion to remand the case? </p>
<p class="calibre1">148</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p149"></a> (A) No, because the federal supplemental jurisdiction statute permits the court to aggregate all of the plaintiffs' claims since they all derive from a common series of transactions, and when aggregated the claims are collectively worth in excess of $75,000. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(B) No, because by case law the claims here may be aggregated for amount-in-controversy purposes since they arise from a common series of transactions, and when aggregated the claims are collectively worth in excess of $75,000. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(C) No, because the plaintiffs waived their right to request remand when more than 30 days passed following the brokerage firm's filing of its notice of removal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(D) Yes, because by case law the fact that the claims are not for a single right in which all plaintiffs have a common interest prevents the claims from being aggregated for amount-in-controversy purposes. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A construction company was incorporated and headquartered in State A. A distributor (a corporation that was a citizen of State B) was in the business of  distributing  asphalt  used  in  the  construction  of  residential  driveways. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  construction  company  placed  a  large  order  for  asphalt  with  the distributor,  and  the  distributor  failed  to  deliver  the  product  on  time.  The construction  company  sued  the  distributor  in  diversity  in  State  A  federal court for breach of contract, claiming losses of more than $3 million from the delay. The distributor then impleaded a trucker that it had hired to ship the  products  in  question  to  the  construction  company.  In  the  distributor's third-party  complaint  against  the  trucker,  the  distributor  alleged  that  the trucker “is or may be liable” to the distributor if the distributor were found liable to the construction company. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Which  of  the  following  defenses,  if  supported  by  the  facts,  may  the trucker properly assert? </p>
<p class="calibre1">(A) The construction company could not recover directly against the trucker. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(B) The distributor may seek to implead the trucker only after, not before, a judgment is entered in the construction company's suit against the distributor. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p150"></a> <b class="calibre3">Question 19</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">A  messenger,  who  is  a  citizen  of  State  A,  drove  his  truck  onto  a construction  site  in  State  A  in  order  to  deliver  a  package.  There  were  a number of other vehicles on the site. The messenger's truck was hit from the  rear  by  one  of  these  vehicles,  injuring  the  messenger.  He  sued  an electrician  (a  citizen  of  State  B),  alleging  that  the  electrician  had negligently  driven  the  vehicle,  a  van,  that  hit  the  messenger's  truck.  The suit, seeking $100,000 in damages, was based on diversity and was filed in State A federal court. The electrician filed an answer denying that he had driven the vehicle that had hit the messenger's truck. Eleven days after the electrician  served  his  answer,  he  also  served  a  third-party  impleader complaint against a plumber (a citizen of State B) who had been driving a truck  on  the  same  site;  that  complaint  alleged  that  it  was  the  plumber whose  truck  hit  the  messenger,  and  that  if  there  was  anyone  whose negligence  caused  the  accident,  that  person  was  the  plumber.  The electrician  made  personal  service  of  the  third-party  complaint  on  the plumber  by  having  the  summons  and  complaint  handed  to  the  plumber while the plumber was doing a multi-week project at a job site in State C, at  a  location  80  miles  from  the  State  A  federal  courthouse  where  the messenger-electrician  suit  was  pending.  No  provision  of  State  A  law would  permit  service  of  process  on  a  defendant  found  at  the  State  C  job site for a complaint in the State A courts on facts analogous to the facts of the electrician-plumber complaint here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The plumber would like to try to get the third-party (“TP”) complaint against  him  dismissed  by  the  federal  court.  Which  of  the  following arguments offers the plumber the best chance of achieving that result? </p>
<p class="calibre1">(A) The court does not have subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate the TP complaint, because the electrician and the plumber are both citizens of State B. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(B) The court does not have personal jurisdiction over the plumber for purposes of adjudicating the TP complaint. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(C) The electrician did not serve the TP complaint within the “of right” </p>
<p class="calibre1">time limit for such service and did not obtain leave of court as required for a TP complaint served after expiration of that “of right” time limit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(D) The TP complaint fails to state a valid third-party claim. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A novelist sued her accountant, an individual, in a federal-court diversity 150</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p151"></a>action based on breach of contract. The novelist, who is a citizen of State A, brought the suit in that state's federal court. After the novelist filed the complaint,  she  instructed  a  process  server  to  serve  the  summons  and complaint  personally  on  the  accountant  at  what  a  recent  check  of  the accountant's  business  website  check  showed  to  be  his  business  address, 123 Main Street, Suite 101, in City, State B. Unbeknownst to the novelist, the  accountant  had  moved  his  office  to  a  different  location  in  City  one month  before  and  had  neglected  to  update  his  website  with  the  new address.  The  process  server  arrived  at  Suite  101  in  the  123  Main  Street office  building  and  asked  the  receptionist  there  if  the  accountant  was present to receive papers. The receptionist replied that the accountant had moved,  but  mentioned  that  she  would  be  seeing  him  the  next  day;  she therefore offered to take the papers and give them to the accountant. The process  server  agreed,  leaving  the  papers  with  the  receptionist,  who  as promised  gave  the  papers  to  the  accountant  the  next  day.  The  accountant then immediately filed a timely answer, in which he raised the defense of improper  service.  The  provisions  of  State  A  and  State  B  regarding  valid methods of service are identical to the ones set forth for federal courts in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Should the court dismiss the complaint for improper service? </p>
<p class="calibre1">(A) Yes, because although the papers were left with a person of suitable age and discretion, this was done at a location that was no longer the accountant's usual place of business. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(B) Yes, because no federal or relevant state statute allows service on an individual by leaving papers with a person of suitable age and discretion at that person's usual place of business. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(C) No, because the process server left the papers with a person of suitable age and discretion at what the accountant represented to the world to be his usual place of business. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(D) No, because the accountant waived any objection to improper service by asserting the defense in an answer instead of by a motion made before the answer. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A  skydiver  was  injured  in  a  skydiving  accident  in  State  A  when  his parachute opened late. The skydiver brought a product liability suit, based on diversity, against  the manufacturer of  the parachute in  State A federal court.  At  trial,  one  of  the  issues  was  the  extent  of  the  skydiver's  injuries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">151</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p152"></a>The  skydiver's  lawyer  offered  into  evidence  that  the  hospital  that  treated the  skydiver  for  his  injuries  billed  him  $200,000  for  care,  and  that  this amount  was  paid  in  full  by  the  skydiver's  health  insurance  carrier  on  his behalf.  The  manufacturer's  lawyer  did  not  contest  the  accuracy  or reasonableness  of  the  hospital's  bill.  Nor  did  the  manufacturer  offer evidence that any person other than itself was fully or partly at fault. The case  was  submitted  to  the  jury  without  any  motion  having  been  made  by either side. The jury returned a verdict of $100,000, and the judge entered judgment for this amount. Under the relevant law of State A, a state trial judge is encouraged to use the “additur” technique where appropriate, i.e., to  conditionally  grant  a  new  trial  in  response  to  a  verdict  for  an  amount markedly  lower  than  that  shown  by  the  clear  weight  of  the  evidence;  the grant  is  conditional  in  the  sense  that  the  new  trial  will  be  canceled  if  the defendant agrees to pay an amount specified by the trial judge as being the minimum justified by the evidence. After the disappointing verdict in the federal action, the skydiver's lawyer asked the judge by motion either (1) to issue an additur under which the manufacturer would be given a choice between  undergoing  a  new  trial  solely  on  the  issue  of  damages  (with liability  deemed  decided  in  the  first  trial)  or  agreeing  to  pay  $200,000  in damages;  or  (2)  alternatively,  to  issue  judgment  as  a  matter  of  law  for $200,000. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Assume that the district judge believes that the weight of the evidence clearly shows that the skydiver has sustained at least $200,000 of damages</p>
<p class="calibre1">—the amount of the hospital bill—for injuries that would be compensable under  State  A's  case  law  on  tort  damages.  Which  of  the  following represents  the  ruling  the  judge  is  most  clearly  authorized  to  make  on  the skydiver's alternative motions? </p>
<p class="calibre1">(A) The court may award judgment as a matter of law (JML) for $200,000, so long as the skydiver made his JML motion for within 28 days after the entry of the judgment for $100,000. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(B) The court may award additur as proposed by the skydiver, because additur represents a substantive legal rule of State A that should be applied by the federal court sitting in diversity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(C) The court may not award additur as proposed by the skydiver, because additur may be applied only in federal-question cases, not in cases based solely on diversity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(D) The court may not apply additur as proposed by the skydiver, because to do so would violate the defendant's jury trial rights under the Seventh Amendment. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Question 24</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">A husband got into a heated argument with his wife. During the course of the  argument,  he  fired  a  hand  gun,  and  the  bullet  ricocheted  off  the  floor and  hit  her,  causing  her  instant  death.  The  man  was  charged  with  second degree  murder  but  instead  was  permitted  to  plead  guilty  to  voluntary manslaughter under a plea agreement with the county prosecutor. A State A  statute  provides  that  voluntary  manslaughter  is  “an  intentional  or reckless killing committed under the effect of extreme emotional distress.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  plea  agreement  stated  that  the  husband  “intentionally  killed  the  wife while  under  the  effect  of  extreme  emotional  distress,”  but  contained  no other  details.  The  State  A  judge,  in  accepting  the  plea,  required  the husband to make an oral allocution before the court, whose purpose was to assure  the  court  that  there  was  a  “factual  basis”  for  the  plea;  the  judge concluded that there was such a basis, though the husband in the allocution denied that he had intended for the bullet to strike his wife. Meanwhile, the husband  was  the  named  beneficiary  of  a  life  insurance  policy  bought  by the wife on her own life. The policy contained a “homicide clause,” which provided  that  the  insurer  would  not  be  liable  under  the  policy  if  the insured's  death  was  the  result  of  a  voluntary  act  by  the  insured  or  her spouse committed with the intent of causing the insured's death. In reliance on  this  clause,  the  insurer  refused  to  make  payment  on  the  policy.  The husband, a State A resident, filed suit in a State A state court to establish 154</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p155"></a>his right to the policy proceeds. The insurance company, as a non-citizen of State A, properly removed to the federal district court for State A. The husband  and  the  insurer  have  agreed  to  have  the  case  decided  by  the federal judge rather than a jury. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The insurer has moved for summary judgment, based on the theory that the  husband's  guilty  plea  conclusively  established  the  fact  that  he intentionally killed the wife, thereby making the policy's homicide clause applicable.  State  A  follows  the  prevailing  national  approach  to  issue preclusion. The federal Court of Appeals for the circuit that includes State A, acting in cases where the court was free to make its own determination about  whether  issue  preclusion  applied,  has  issued  opinions  taking  that same  prevailing  national  approach  to  issue  preclusion.  How  should  the federal court rule on the insurer's motion? </p>
<p class="calibre1">(A) Because the State A courts would apply issue preclusion to prevent the husband from denying that he intentionally killed the wife, the federal court must follow the State A approach and apply such preclusion too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(B) Because the State A courts would not apply issue preclusion to prevent the husband from denying that he intentionally killed the wife, the federal court must follow the State A approach and decline to apply such preclusion too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(C) The federal court should follow federal case law from the circuit, and under that case law issue preclusion will not apply, because the issue of the husband's intent was never actually litigated in the criminal proceeding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(D) The federal court should follow federal case law from the circuit, and under that case law issue preclusion will apply, because the husband's guilty plea constituted a final and conclusive determination that the killing was intentional. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Question 25</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Plaintiff  brought  a  diversity  suit  in  federal  court  against  Defendant.  The suit  claimed  that  several  years  previously,  Defendant,  an  individual,  had breached  a  contract  to  deliver  certain  food  colorings  to  Plaintiff,  also  an individual,  for  use  in  Plaintiff's  bakery.  Plaintiff  filed  the  complaint  with the district court on March 1. On March 3, Plaintiff requested by mail that Defendant  waive  service,  and  Defendant  did  so  by  returning  the  waiver form  on  March  10.  On  March  15,  Defendant  served  his  answer,  which consisted solely of a general denial. On April 20, Defendant first realized 155</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p156"></a>that  he  probably  had  a  valid  defense  based  on  the  statute  of  limitations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Defendant's  lawyer  decided  not  to  ask  Plaintiff  to  consent  to  Defendant's immediate filing of an amended answer that would include the limitations defense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Which  of  the  following  statements  best  describes  whether  and  how Defendant may, on April 20, assert the limitations defense? </p>
<p class="calibre1">(A) Defendant may assert the defense by amending his answer as of right, because due to his having signed the waiver his original time to answer has not yet run. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(B) Defendant may not assert the defense by amending his answer unless he receives leave of court to do so, because more than 21 days have passed since Defendant's service of his original answer, and that answer did not require a responsive pleading. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(C) Defendant may not assert the defense by amending his answer unless he receives leave of court, because his filing of an answer that did not contain an affirmative defense in his answer resulted in his automatic waiver of that defense and left him without the ability to amend as of right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(D) Defendant may, as of right, make a motion asserting the defense. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Question 26</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Defendant, a corporation that manufactures automobile tires, entered into a long-term sales contract with Plaintiff, company that distributes used cars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Plaintiff, dissatisfied with the quality of Defendant's tires, filed a diversity action  in  federal  court  against  Defendant.  The  complaint  alleged  three claims: breach of warranty, strict liability, and breach of contract. On April 1,  the  district  court  granted  Plaintiff's  motion  for  partial  summary judgment  (judgment  only  as  to  the  contract  claim)  and  ordered  a  trial  on the  two  remaining  claims.  The  court's  opinion  granting  the  partial summary judgment said nothing about whether the judgment was deemed final or whether there was any reason to allow an immediate appeal from it. On April 15, Defendant filed a motion in the appropriate federal court of  appeals,  asking  that  court  to  hear  an  immediate  appeal  of  the  grant  of partial summary judgment. On April 25, Plaintiff filed a written consent to this appeal—he did so in the hopes that if he won that appeal, Defendant would  immediately  settle  the  contract  claim  without  a  trial  in  return  for Plaintiff's dropping the other two claims. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Assuming that the appeals court desires to hear the immediate appeal, 156</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p157"></a>does that court have jurisdiction to do so? </p>
<p class="calibre1">(A) Yes, because the grant of partial summary judgment is a final judgment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(B) Yes, because the grant of partial summary judgment, although an interlocutory order, may be immediately appealed in the discretion of either the trial or appeals court. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(C) No, because the grant of partial summary judgment here was an interlocutory order from which no immediate appeal is possible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(D) No, because the parties did not file their consent to the appeal within ten days of the court's entry of its order. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Question 27</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">An  engineer  worked  for  many  years  for  a  manufacturer  of  auto  airbags. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  engineer's  job  was  both  to  design,  and  to  evaluate  the  safety  of,  the manufacturer's airbag inflation systems. Three years ago, the engineer quit and  began  giving  paid  expert  testimony  against  the  manufacturer  in  civil suits brought by consumers who said they had been injured when airbags made  by  the  manufacturer  had  detonated  prematurely;  the  engineer testified  that  based  on  his  own  experience  working  for  the  manufacturer, the  airbags  in  question  were  defectively  designed.  The  manufacturer responded  to  this  testimony  by  suing  the  engineer  in  State  A  state  court, alleging  that  his  testimony  unfairly  disclosed  the  manufacturer's  trade secrets. The manufacturer and the engineer then settled this suit. As part of the settlement, both parties asked the State A judge to enter an injunction prohibiting  the  engineer  from  “giving  testimony,  by  deposition  or  trial testimony,  in  any  personal  injury  suit  brought  in  any  American  state  or federal  court  against  [the  manufacturer]  concerning  [the  engineer's]</p>
<p class="calibre1">knowledge  of  the  design  of  manufacturer's  airbag  systems.”  The  judge entered the requested injunction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shortly  thereafter,  a  consumer  was  injured  in  a  car  crash  in  State  B</p>
<p class="calibre1">when  an  airbag  system  made  by  the  manufacturer  allegedly  failed  to inflate  properly  in  the  consumer's  car.  The  consumer  brought  a  diversity action based on product liability against the manufacturer in federal district court for State B. The consumer's lawyer issued a subpoena to compel the engineer to testify about his personal knowledge of the design of the airbag at  issue  in  the  consumer's  case.  The  state  courts  of  State  B  have  said  in past  opinions  that  the  state  has  a  strong  public  interest  in  ensuring  that potential witnesses with knowledge of pertinent matters not be barred from 157</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p158"></a>testifying  to  that  knowledge  on  account  of  confidentiality  agreements between the witness and another private party. The manufacturer has now asserted in the federal court action that under the relevant federal full faith and credit statute, the federal court has a duty to exclude any testimony by the  engineer  about  matters  covered  by  the  injunction,  including  the engineer's knowledge about the manufacturer's airbag designs. Should the federal  court  grant  the  manufacturer's  request  to  exclude  the  engineer's testimony? </p>
<p class="calibre1">(A) No, because the application of full faith and credit principles must yield to any strong countervailing public-policy interest on the part of State B, and admitting the engineer's testimony here would serve such a public-policy interest held by that state. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(B) No, because the admissibility of evidence is not governed by full faith and credit principles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(C) Yes, because the principles of claim preclusion embodied in the federal full faith and credit statute require a State B federal court to enforce the injunction issued by the State A court even if a State B</p>
<p class="calibre1">state court would not issue such an injunction on comparable facts if the suit were pending in that court. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(D) Yes, so long as the federal court believes that the State A judge who issued the injunction would on request modify it to allow the engineer to obey the subpoena and give the testimony sought here. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Question 28</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Plaintiff  is  a  widow  whose  husband  was  killed  in  an  accident  while working  for  Defendant,  a  construction  company.  Plaintiff  is  a  citizen  of State  A.  Defendant  is  incorporated  in  and  has  its  principal  place  of business in State B. Plaintiff brought a diversity action against Defendant in  federal  district  court  for  State  A,  alleging  negligence  and  seeking $100,000  in  damages.  Defendant  filed  a  third-party  claim  against Distributor,  seeking  $100,000  in  damages  and  alleging  that  if  Defendant were  to  be  found  liable  to  Plaintiff,  Distributor  would  be  liable  to Defendant  for  having  leased  to  Defendant  the  defective  equipment  that caused  the  accident.  Distributor  is  incorporated  in  State  A  and  has  its principal place of business there. Plaintiff then amended her complaint to assert  a  defective-product  claim  directly  against  Distributor;  the  claim sought $100,000 in damages. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Defendant  and  Distributor  have  now  moved  to  dismiss  the  claims 158</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p159"></a>against  them  based  on  lack  of  subject-matter  jurisdiction.  Defendant moves  to  dismiss  Plaintiff's  negligence  claim,  and  Distributor  moves  to dismiss both claims against it, Defendant's third-party claim, and Plaintiff's direct claim. The court should dispose of these motions by (A) granting all of the motions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(B) granting only Distributor's motion as to both claims against it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(C) granting only Distributor's motion, and only as to Plaintiff's claim against it. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A  screenwriter  wanted  to  bring  a  federal  lawsuit  for  copyright infringement against a movie studio that he believed had copied elements of his unpublished screenplay. He consulted a lawyer, who agreed to bring the  case.  The  lawyer  drafted  a  complaint,  signed  it,  and  filed  it  with  the court. At about the same time, the screenwriter and the lawyer agreed that a  jury  would  probably  be  more  sympathetic  to  the  screenwriter's  claim than  would  be  a  judge,  so  they  tentatively  decided  to  demand  a  jury  trial on the infringement claim. However, the lawyer and the screenwriter also decided that it would be best to postpone making the jury-trial demand as long  as  possible,  since  later  events  in  the  case,  including  the  attitude  of whatever judge was assigned, might cause them to change their mind and prefer a bench trial instead of a jury trial. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  following  times  for  the  screenwriter  to  demand  a  jury  trial  are arranged  in  anticipated  chronological  order,  with  the  earliest-to-occur listed  first.  Which  choice  represents  the  LATEST  stage  at  which  the screenwriter can serve a demand on the studio for a jury trial while being confident that his demand will not be deemed to have been waived? </p>
<p class="calibre1">(A) At the same time as the summons and complaint are served on the studio. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(B) Within 60 days after the studio serves its answer, if the answer does not contain a counterclaim. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(C) On or before the date on which the parties' lawyers conduct their initial case-planning conference required by FRCP 26(f). </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p160"></a> <b class="calibre3">Question 30</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The plaintiff, while driving on April 2, was injured in a collision with a car driven by the defendant. The plaintiff believed that the defendant had gone through  a  stop  sign.  The  police  officer  at  the  scene  did  not  perform  a sobriety test, but the plaintiff thought she smelled liquor on the defendant's breath.  The  plaintiff  brought  a  negligence  suit  against  the  defendant  in State  A  state  court.  The  plaintiff's  lawyer  then  engaged  a  private investigator  to  try  to  find  out  whether  the  defendant  had  been  drinking prior  to  the  accident.  The  investigator  located  a  musician  who  had  the status  of  “friend”  of  the  defendant  on  a  particular  social  media  website. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  investigator  conducted  an  interview  with  the  musician,  at  which  she told  the  investigator  that  on  April  3,  the  defendant  had  posted  a  message on the social media website in which he said “I had a few beers yesterday and then got into a car accident, but fortunately the dumb cop didn't make me  walk  a  white  line.”  The  musician  then  at  the  investigator's  request wrote a handwritten statement with these facts, signed it, and handed it to the investigator, who gave it to the plaintiff's lawyer. The plaintiff's lawyer plans to call the musician at trial to testify about the defendant's admission of drinking, and plans to use the statement either in its case in chief, or to rehabilitate  that  testimony  if  the  defendant  claims  on  cross-examination that the musician's testimony is a recent fabrication. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The defendant, during discovery, made a demand for the production of any written statements in the possession of the plaintiff or her attorney by any person with knowledge relevant to the accident. The plaintiff's lawyer submitted a “privilege log” to the defendant, mentioning the musician by name,  and  stating  that  the  musician  had  given  a  written  statement  to  the plaintiff's  legal  team  about  a  matter  relevant  to  the  accident;  but  the plaintiff's  lawyer  refused  to  produce  the  statement  itself  on  the  grounds that  it  was  protected  by  work-product  immunity.  The  defendant  has  now moved  for  a  court  order  compelling  production  of  the  statement  on  the grounds that any work-product immunity should not prevent production on these  facts.  State  A  follows  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure  on  all matters relevant to discovery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Should the court grant the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff to produce the statement? </p>
<p class="calibre1">(A) Yes, because the defendant is entitled to a copy of his own prior admissions regarding the action or its subject matter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(B) Yes, because the statement contains only the musician's own words 160</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p161"></a>and does not reveal any mental impressions or legal theories of the plaintiff's legal team. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(C) No, because the defendant and his attorney have not demonstrated that they cannot obtain their own statement from the musician that would be substantially equivalent to the one being sought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(D) No, because the use the plaintiff intends to make of the statement at trial, if it's used at all, will be solely to enhance the musician's credibility as a witness. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Question 31</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Plaintiff lives in State A. He bought hiking equipment from Defendant, a catalog retailer that is incorporated in, and has its headquarters in, State B. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Plaintiff, from his home in State A, selected his purchase from a copy of Defendant's hard-copy catalog; he then placed his order by telephone to a sales  agent  working  out  of  Defendant's  State  B  headquarters.  20%  of Defendant's  annual  sales  are  made  by  mail-order  and  Internet-order  to customers who live in State A. However, Defendant has no employees or agents  physically  located  in  State  A.  The  hiking  equipment  turned  out  to be defective, and Plaintiff decided to sue Defendant in State A state court for  a  refund.  Before  filing  the  suit,  Plaintiff  looked  on  the  Internet  and located Defendant's published street address in State B. However, Plaintiff did not serve a copy of the summons and complaint on Defendant either by mail or hand-delivery to that State B address. Instead, Plaintiff discovered a State A statute providing that “Service for an action in this state may be made upon a nonresident company that is registered to do business in this state by means of hand-delivery of the summons and complaint to the State A  Secretary  of  State  at  the  Secretary's  official  address  in  Capital  City, State  A.”  Plaintiff  therefore  served  Defendant  by  having  his  agent  hand-deliver a copy of the summons and complaint to the State A Secretary of State as provided in the statute. It is unclear what additional actions, if any, were  taken  by  either  Plaintiff  or  the  Secretary  of  State  to  attempt  to  give Defendant actual notice of the suit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Defendant  did  not  appear  in  the  action,  and  a  default  judgment  was entered  against  it  by  the  State  A  court  last  year.  Defendant  now  seeks  to have the default judgment re-opened, and the suit dismissed for improper service;  Defendant  claims  not  to  have  received  actual  notice  of  the  suit until this year. (The statute of limitations ran on Dec. 31 of last year, so if the  court  finds  that  Defendant  was  not  validly  served  prior  to  Dec.  31, Plaintiff  will  not  be  able  to  re-serve  Defendant.)  Defendant  does  not 161</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p162"></a>dispute  that  it  is  registered  to  do  business  in  State  A,  but  claims  that whatever service occurred did not comport with the Due Process Clause of the  Fourteenth  Amendment.  The  following  choices  list,  in  estimated ascending  order  of  the  likelihood  that  they  would  have  given  Defendant actual  notice  of  the  suit,  various  additional  steps  that  might  have  been taken  to  notify  Defendant  of  the  suit.  Which  choice  represents  the additional  step(s)  beyond  service  on  the  Secretary  of  State  that  would  be the LEAST likely-to-be-effective notice steps that would nonetheless have been  sufficient  to  give  Defendant  constitutionally-sufficient  notice  of  the suit? </p>
<p class="calibre1">(A) No other acts calculated to give notice to Defendant were required, because service was constitutionally sufficient as soon as Plaintiff hand-delivered the summons and complaint to the state official. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(B) Notice published in a newspaper of general circulation widely distributed through State B would have sufficed (if done in addition to the delivery of the summons and complaint to the state official). </p>
<p class="calibre1">(C) A mailing of the summons and complaint to Defendant at its last-known address, by either Plaintiff or the Secretary of State, would have sufficed (if done in addition to the delivery of the summons and complaint to the state official). </p>
<p class="calibre1">(D) Only hand delivery of the summons and complaint by Plaintiff or his agent to Defendant's published address in State B would have sufficed (even if there had been delivery of the summons and complaint to the state official), given that Plaintiff knew that published address. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Question 32</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Plaintiff was born in State A and has lived there her entire life. For the last 20 years she worked as a data-entry operator for Employer, a corporation incorporated  in,  and  with  its  principal  place  of  business  in,  State  B. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Employer  announced  one  day  that  it  was  outsourcing  its  data-entry operations  and  gave  Plaintiff  the  choice  between  transferring  to  a  lower-paying  job  and  being  fired.  Plaintiff  refused  the  transfer  and  was  fired. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Plaintiff believed that Employer had discriminated against her because of her  age.  She  therefore  brought  a  lawsuit  against  Employer  and  Manager, the controlling shareholder of Employer who, Plaintiff believed, made the decision  to  force  her  to  choose  between  being  fired  or  taking  the  lower-paying  job.  Manager,  an  individual,  lives  and  works  in  State  A.  The complaint  contained  two  claims.  The  first  claim  was  against  Employer alone  and  asserted  that  Employer  had  violated  the  federal  Age  Bias  Act 162</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p163"></a>(ABA Act), which provides, “No employer shall discriminate on the basis of  age.”  The  second  claim  was  against  both  Manager  and  Employer;  it alleged  that  (1)  Employer  breached  Plaintiff's  employment  contract,  a clause  of  which  said  that  Employee  could  only  be  fired  for  “repeated unwillingness  or  inability  to  perform  the  essential  functions  of  the  job”; and  (2)  Manager  used  his  control  of  Employer  to  cause  Employer  to breach  the  contract,  thereby  himself  committing  the  tort  of  interference with contract. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Plaintiff filed her lawsuit in a federal district court located in State A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both  claims  seek  more  than  $100,000  in  damages  against  each  party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manager has moved to dismiss the claim against him for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. How should the court resolve the motion? </p>
<p class="calibre1">(A) The court should deny the motion because the court can exercise federal-question jurisdiction over Manager since the ABA claim arises under a federal statute. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(B) The court should deny the motion because it can exercise federal diversity jurisdiction over Manager. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(C) The court has power to hear the claim against Manager since that claim is closely related to a federal-question claim in the case, and there is no reason for the court to exercise its discretion not to hear the claim against Manager. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(d) The court should grant the motion because Manager is a pendent party over whom the court cannot exercise jurisdiction on these facts. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Question 33</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In  State  A,  an  accountant  got  into  a  taxi  cab  owned  by  a  company  that employed the driver as a full-time driver. During the trip, the cab collided with  a  truck  whose  driver  sped  away  and  was  never  located.  The accountant  brought  a  negligence  suit  in  a  State  A  court  known  as  a  “city court,”  whose  jurisdiction  was  limited  to  claims  not  to  exceed  $250,000, but  whose  procedures  were  otherwise  identical  to  those  of  the  State  A courts  of  general  jurisdiction.  The  suit  was  solely  against  the  cab  driver, and  the  relief  sought  was  $20,000  to  compensate  for  property  damage caused  during  the  collision  to  a  framed  oil  painting  that  the  accountant owned and was carrying with her in the cab. After the resulting jury trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the cab driver, and the judge entered final judgment. The accountant then brought a $200,000 negligence suit in a State A court of general jurisdiction against the company that owned the 163</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p164"></a>cab,  for  personal  injuries  the  accountant  had  sustained  in  the  same collision. The company moved to dismiss the suit on account of the earlier judgment in favor of the cab driver. Will the court dismiss the suit on this ground? </p>
<p class="calibre1">(A) Yes, based on the doctrine of issue preclusion (or “collateral estoppel”). </p>
<p class="calibre1">(B) Yes, based on the doctrine of claim preclusion (or “res judicata”). </p>
<p class="calibre1">(C) No, because the cab company would not have been bound had the judgment in the earlier suit been in favor of the accountant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(D) No, because the first suit was in a court of limited jurisdiction, making any form of preclusion unfair to the accountant. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Question 34</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">A  plumber  who  lived  in  State  A  had  surgery  in  a  hospital,  which  was operated by a non-profit corporation incorporated and located in State A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  serious  infection  set  in,  which  the  plumber  believed  was  negligently handled  by  the  hospital.  After  partly  recovering,  the  plumber  moved permanently to State  B. Then, shortly  before expiration of  State A's two-year  statute  of  limitations  on  medical  malpractice  claims,  the  plumber brought a $300,000 diversity action for malpractice against the hospital in the federal district court located in State A. The legislature of State A has enacted  a  statute  providing  that  before  any  medical  malpractice  suit  may be  filed  in  the  State  A  courts  against  a  hospital  located  in  that  state,  the claimant  must  first  send  a  “notice  of  claim”  to  the  hospital  stating  the claimant's  intent  to  sue  and  the  nature  of  the  claimed  malpractice;  only after waiting for 60 days following the giving of this notice is the claimant permitted to file the malpractice suit in the state A courts. The purpose of the  notice-of-claim  provision  is  to  give  the  hospital  the  chance  to investigate and negotiate a settlement before a malpractice suit is publicly filed,  thereby  reducing  the  cost  of  hospital  malpractice  insurance  by encouraging  lower-cost  settlements.  In  the  case  of  the  plumber's  federal suit, the hospital's lawyer noticed that the plumber had not given a notice of claim prior to filing that suit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  hospital  has  now,  in  a  timely  manner,  moved  the  State  A  federal court to dismiss the case. The motion makes two arguments for dismissal: (1) because diversity of citizenship is lacking; and (2) because the federal court  must  enforce  the  notice-of  claim  requirement,  thus  requiring  it  to dismiss  for  failure  to  state  a  claim  for  which  relief  may  be  granted.  The 164</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p165"></a>federal judge should</p>
<p class="calibre1">(A) allow the suit to proceed, because there is diversity, and the notice-of-claim provision is a procedural rule that is therefore not binding on the federal court. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(B) dismiss the suit, because the plumber was a citizen of State A at the time the malpractice claim arose, preventing him from having diversity of citizenship as to the hospital. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(C) dismiss the suit, because the notice-of-claim requirement is sufficiently bound up with the substantive rights of the parties that the federal court must enforce that requirement since the State A courts would do so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(D) dismiss the suit, because the court must apply the State A notice-of-claim rule as long as there is a non-trivial chance that the decision on whether to apply that rule will be outcome-determinative. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Question 35</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">A woman brought suit in State A federal district court against the company she  worked  for,  claiming  that  it  had  failed  to  promote  her  on  account  of her  gender,  in  violation  of  a  federal  employment-discrimination  statute. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  woman  is  a  citizen  of  State  A;  the  company  is  a  corporation incorporated in State B, with its headquarters in State C and with most of its  employees  working  at  the  office  in  State  A  where  the  woman  works. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The relief sought by the suit consisted solely of $46,000 in back pay. Two months after the company timely filed its answer, and while discovery was still  pending,  the  company  made  a  motion  to  dismiss  the  suit  for  lack  of subject-matter jurisdiction. Will the federal court grant the motion? </p>
<p class="calibre1">(A) Yes, because the company is a citizen of several states, one of which is the same as the woman's state of citizenship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(B) Yes, because although there is diversity of citizenship, the amount in controversy requirement is not met. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(C) No, because the woman's claim arises under federal law. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(D) No, because the company waived its objection by failing to assert it either in its answer or in a motion made before it served its answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Question 36</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Plaintiff is a franchisor of brake-repair services for automobiles. Plaintiff's headquarters are in State A, a state located in the southwestern part of the 165</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p166"></a>U.S.  Plaintiff  issues  franchises  for  the  operation  of  local  brake-repair stores  to  franchisees  located  in  all  50  states,  as  well  as  in  20  foreign countries.  Defendant,  an  individual  with  considerable  business sophistication, was and is a citizen and resident of Canada. After meeting with  Plaintiff's  two-person  Canadian  sales  office  regarding  his  desire  to buy  a  franchise  from  Plaintiff,  Defendant  negotiated  for  6  months  to complete the purchase. The franchise was to be located in eastern Canada, about 2,000 miles from Plaintiff's State A headquarters. Most negotiations occurred  by  telephone  and  email,  with  Defendant  participating  from  his home  in  Canada  and  Plaintiff  from  its  State  A  headquarters.  During  that period,  Plaintiff's  only  connections  with  State  A  were  that  he  travelled twice  to  Plaintiff's  headquarters  for  face-to-face  negotiating  sessions,  and on  one  of  those  trips  also  attended  a  three-day  “prospective  franchisee training  session”  there.  Defendant  then  signed  his  copy  of  the  final contract  in  Canada,  and  Plaintiff  signed  its  copy  in  State  A.  The  contract said  that  any  disputes  would  be  “resolved  according  to  the  laws  of  State A,” and said nothing about in which court(s) a suit on the contract could be brought. The contract also required Plaintiff to support Defendant's efforts as  to  sales,  marketing,  finance,  and  operations,  and  indicated  that  most such support work by Plaintiff would be done by employees working from Plaintiff's headquarters. After signing the contract, Plaintiff never travelled to State A, and never did any business in the state, or with State A parties, other  than  having  some  dealings  by  telephone  with  Plaintiff's  personnel located in the state. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  Defendant  failed  to  make  required  payments  of  monthly franchise  fees,  Plaintiff  brought  a  breach-of-contract  action  against Defendant based on diversity in federal district court for State A. The State A  long-arm  grants  the  State  A  courts  personal  jurisdiction  to  hear  all disputes concerning contracts, if one party to the contract is an individual or business located in State A, and if such exercise of personal jurisdiction</p>
<p class="calibre1">“would  be  consistent  with  the  due  process  limits  imposed  by  the  U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Constitution.” Before filing an answer to the suit, Defendant made a timely motion that the court lacked personal jurisdiction over him. The trial court denied  the  motion.  Defendant  tried  the  case  on  the  merits,  lost,  and  then appealed the adverse judgment to the appropriate federal Court of Appeal on the grounds that the trial court erred in concluding that it had personal jurisdiction over Defendant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Should the federal Court of Appeals reverse the judgment and dismiss the case for lack of personal jurisdiction? </p>
<p class="calibre1">166</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p167"></a> (A) No, because by raising and losing the jurisdiction question and then continuing to trial on the merits, Defendant waived the right to raise the jurisdiction issue on appeal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(B) No, because Defendant should have anticipated being required to defend an action in State A, making it not unfair to require him to do so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(C) Yes, because although Defendant had minimum contacts with State A, it would violate traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice to require him to defend this suit in State A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(D) Yes, because Defendant did not voluntarily avail himself of the privilege of doing business in State A, thereby preventing him from having minimum contacts with that state. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Question 37</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Company  manufactures  off-road  recreational  vehicles.  Driver  owns  a vehicle  manufactured  by  Company.  Driver  was  injured  while  driving  the vehicle on the highway. A state trooper was called and arrived at the scene of  the  accident.  Driver  has  informed  Company  that  he  intends  to  file  a federal  action,  based  on  diversity  jurisdiction,  for  injuries  caused  by  the car's  alleged  product-design  defects;  Driver  claims  that  the  vehicle accelerated when it was supposed to brake, and as a result it rolled into a ditch.  Company  now  wants  to  find  out  whatever  the  state  trooper  knows about the accident. Company has filed a verified petition with the federal district court in the district in which the accident occurred, asking the court to issue an order granting Company permission to depose the state trooper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  petition  does  not  specify  any  particular  topics  to  be  covered  in  the deposition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Should the court issue the requested order? </p>
<p class="calibre1">(A) No, because in federal civil practice a party may not take discovery from a nonparty before the commencement of a lawsuit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(B) No, because a party may take discovery before a suit is commenced only if the request is accompanied by a draft complaint against the party from whom discovery is sought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(C) Yes, because a party to an anticipated federal civil suit may depose a non-party witness who is believed to be in possession of information that is relevant to a claim or defense that is expected to be raised in the suit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(D) No, because a party may not take discovery before the commencement 167</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p168"></a>of a federal lawsuit absent a special need to preserve testimony. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Question 38</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Plaintiff is an insurance company incorporated and headquartered in State A.  It  issued  a  liability  insurance  policy  to  Defendant,  a  company incorporated  and  headquartered  in  State  B  that  operates  an  interstate  bus line.  A  bus  driver  employed  by  Defendant  crashed  into  a  car  on  an interstate highway in State B. More than a dozen individuals, both drivers and passengers, were seriously injured. Under the policy, Plaintiff insured Defendant  for  claims  aggregating  up  to  $3  million  arising  from  any accidents occurring during the one-year policy period where a single driver was  at  the  wheel  of  a  bus  owned  by  the  Defendant.  Ten  of  the  injured parties  brought  individual  negligence  suits  against  Defendant  in  various state courts. Two of the claimants are citizens of State A, three are citizens of State B, and the remaining five are citizens of States C, D, E, F, and G, respectively. The individual claims were for sums between $10,000 and $3</p>
<p class="calibre1">million. Plaintiff then filed a statutory interpleader action in federal court in  State  B.  The  interpleader  action  purported  to  join  all  ten  state-court claimants (each of whom was individually personally served in his or her home state). As part of the interpleader action, Plaintiff requested that the federal court enjoin each claimant from trying to collect any amounts from Plaintiff  under  the  policy  in  the  separate  state-court  actions  (though Plaintiff did not ask that the claimants be enjoined from seeking judgments against  Defendant  in  those  state-court  actions).  The  ten  claimants  hired  a lawyer  to  represent  them  jointly  in  the  interpleader  action.  The  lawyer sought to have the interpleader action dismissed on procedural grounds so that the 10 state-court suits could proceed unimpeded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Which  of  the  following  statements  best  summarizes  how  the  federal court should dispose of one or both requests of the parties (i.e., Plaintiff's request for injunctions and/or the claimants' joint request for dismissal of the interpleader action)? </p>
<p class="calibre1">(A) The court must dismiss the entire interpleader suit if complete diversity does not exist between Plaintiff and all of the claimants. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(B) The court must dismiss from the interpleader suit any claimant whose individual claims, when aggregated together, do not total at least $75,000 in value. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(C) The court must dismiss the interpleader suit if Plaintiff fails to either deposit the $3 million policy limit in cash with the court or to furnish a 168</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p169"></a>bond in that amount, after being ordered by the court to do so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(D) Even if the court properly declines to dismiss the interpleader suit, the court may not issue the injunctions against continuation of the state-court actions. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Question 39</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Three years ago, a limited partnership as plaintiff brought a suit, stated to be  based  on  the  alienage  variety  of  diversity,  against  the  defendant,  a corporation,  in  federal  court  for  the  district  of  State  A.  The  defendant corporation  was  and  is  a  citizen  of  State  A,  since  it  was  incorporated  in that state and has its principal place of business there. The partnership was and still is organized under the law of Canada, with its principal place of business  also  in  Canada.  At  the  time  the  suit  was  filed,  the  partnership consisted  of  a  general  partner  (a  corporation  that  was  solely  a  citizen  of Canada)  and  ten  limited  partners,  all  individuals.  Eight  of  the  limited partners were citizens of Canada; two were citizens of State A. Last year, after  discovery  had  been  completed  but  the  case  not  yet  tried,  the  two limited partners who were citizens of State A left the partnership because they  sold  their  interests  to  the  other  limited  partners,  and  under  the partnership  agreement  were  thus  required  to  leave  the  partnership.  (This sale  and  exit  happened  for  reasons  unrelated  to  the  lawsuit.)  This  year, after a one-month trial, the jury rendered a verdict in favor of the plaintiff partnership.  The  next  day,  before  any  judgment  had  been  entered,  the defendant  corporation  moved  to  have  the  action  dismissed  for  lack  of subject matter jurisdiction, in that there had not been complete diversity of citizenship  between  the  parties  at  the  time  the  suit  was  filed  three  years ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Should the district court grant the defense motion and dismiss the suit for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction? </p>
<p class="calibre1">(A) Yes, because at the time suit was commenced the partnership was a citizen of both Canada and State A, preventing the existence of complete alienage diversity between the partnership and the corporation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(B) Yes, so long as the court does not believe that the defendant learned or should have learned of the two limited partners' State A citizenship prior to the start of the trial. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(C) No, because the two limited partners' exit from the partnership prior to the start of trial was a timely cure for any lack of subject-matter 169</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p170"></a>jurisdiction that might otherwise have existed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(D) No, because a partnership is deemed to be a citizen of the place where it was formed, plus the place of its principal place of business, so there was complete alienage diversity jurisdiction at the time the suit was filed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Question 40</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Purchaser  is  an  individual  who  lives  in  State  A  and  operates  a  factory  in State B. He entered into a contract with Seller, a company incorporated in State  C.  The  contract  provided  that  goods  purchased  under  the  contract were  to  be  delivered  from  Seller's  warehouse  in  State  D  to  Purchaser's factory in State B. Seller failed to deliver the goods on time, and Purchaser brought  a  diversity  suit  against  Seller  in  federal  court  for  the  District  of State  A.  Soon  after  the  case  was  filed  (but  after  the  statute  of  limitations for bringing such an action had expired), Purchaser moved for a change of venue to the Western District of State B, the district in which Purchaser's factory was located. Seller opposed the transfer. Assume that the court has concluded that litigating in the Western District of State B would be more convenient overall for the parties and the witnesses, considered as a group, than litigation in the District of State A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How should the district court resolve the transfer motion? </p>
<p class="calibre1">(A) Grant the motion, so long as Purchaser could initially have brought the action in the Western District of State B. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(B) Deny the motion, because Purchaser, having chosen the action's original venue, waived the right to request a transfer of the action. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(C) Deny the motion, because changes of venue, even in the federal system, may not cross state boundaries if the suit is based solely on diversity of citizenship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(D) Dismiss the action if the court concludes that the District of State A was not a district in which venue was ever proper. </p>
